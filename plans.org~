Myself
- Filipa Calado, call me Professor.
- Background in Literature, Queer studies, Digital Studies

  different forms of language, how these are affected by technology
  (recently things like AI) and how to use tech to study language.
- Teaching for 8 years across NYC universities, NYU, New School,
  CUNY; classes on writing, critical thinking, data science, creative
  coding. So a wide range.
- First semseter teaching at Pratt, am very excited.

The course
- INFO 601:
  - Introduction to the field of "information studies"
    - broad term, encompasses work by librarians, analysts, cultural
      heritage curators, managers
  - Exploring the question, what is information? How does form affect
    meaning? Source, platform, speaker, audience, material substrate.
  - Thinking critically about information production
  - Different specializations and jobs available to info practitioners
  - Also, an introduction to graduate school, to thinking, reading,
    and writing critically.
    - how to insert yourself into an academic/professional
      conversation.
  - Finally, we take a critical perspective that pays attention to
    structures of power and how they affect all aspects of
    information.
- Assignments:
  - readings every week
  - posting on discussion board every week
  - some 'fieldwork' (attending 2 events and writing about it)
  - final project (book review) highly scaffolded
  - class discussion major focus.

Will go through the syllabus in more detail. But for now let's do
introductions.

Around the room, say your name, program, and best content you've
consumed lately.

How to read for grad school
- how do you read longer things? More academic things?

- is there an order or way to go about it?
- Now, read the article in 10 minutes, while thinking about:
  - Do these seem like good strategies, why or why not?
  - What have you done that works for you, and what do you think
    wouldn't work?
- share & discuss


"Information" freewrite and discussion

  - Where do you get your information? Make a list.
  - How do you determine if it's good or bad information? Credible?
    How important is this step?

    world?
