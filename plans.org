** week 1, introduction to the course
Agenda:
- Syllabus day
- introductions, myself and you
- overview of the course, assignments, readings
- break
- talk about reading for grad school
- close reading practice: mark zuckerberg video

Myself
- Filipa Calado, call me Professor.
- Background in Literature, Queer studies, Digital studies
- Using technology to study queer literature (dissertation)
  - Now interested in language broadly, how meaning changes across
    different forms of language, how these are affected by technology
    (recently things like AI) and how to use tech to study language.
- During my PhD, taught for 8 years across NYC universities, NYU, New
  School, CUNY; classes on writing, critical thinking, data science,
  creative coding. So a wide range.d
- Second year teaching course, still figuring it out, very excited. 

The course
- INFO 601:
  - This course has two purposes:
    - Introduction to "information studies" as a field. 
      - what is information studies? Broad term about the organization
	of information, and the fields that study information.
      - how is knowledge collected, organized, analyzed, preserved,
        displayed?
      - encompasses work by librarians, analysts, cultural heritage
	curators, managers
      - roots in Library Science, but now includes Museums, Archives,
	Data Analysis, Design. 
    - In this class, we will be examining various perspectives of how
      technolgy affects information.
      - How does form, the container, of information affect its
        meaning?
      - Source, platform, speaker, audience, material substrate.
      - Thinking critically about information production
    - Also, an introduction to graduate school, to thinking, reading,
      and writing critically.
      - how to read intensive and long texts, how to get what you need
        from them.
      - how to write critically and in depth about a topic.
        - how to insert yourself into an academic/professional
          conversation.
        - critical analysis: how to do a "close reading" -- look at
          the components of something to analyze it in depth.
- Assignments:
  - readings every week
  - posting on discussion board every week
  - some 'fieldwork' (attending 2 events and writing about it)
  - final project (close reading paper) highly scaffolded
  - class discussion major focus.

Will go through the syllabus in more detail. But for now let's do
introductions.

Around the room, say your name, program, and best thing you've watched
lately.  

- Professor Calado; Jurassic Park. They make the same mistake every
  time. I love it.

    - focus is on close analysis of examples
    - last month of the semseter will be focused on this assignment.
  - Course Schedule
    - weeks are broken up into "themes" in bold
    - example: next week is AI, the follwing is cyborgs
    - Also weeks that pertain to different programs in the dept, like
      design and archives
    - do not read ahead
    - questions?

BREAK

How to read for grad school (40 min)
- read essay, 10 min.
- Freewrite, 7 min:
  - how do you read longer things? More academic things?
  - what strategies (if any) do you use?
- share & discuss (10-12 min)

Close reading practice (45 - 60 min)
- watch video of Mark Zuckerberg 2 times.
- first time:
  - focus on surface level & context: what is his main argument and
    who is he speaking to? What are his overall goals? What is he
    responding to?
- second time:
  - think about his persuasive strategies in particular.
  - what is he trying to elicit in the audience? What reactions,
    reasoning, feelings?
- Freewrite (10): what are the strategies that Zuckerberg uses to make his
  argument? Focus on one or two moments.
  - What does this strategy reveal about his goals, methods, or
    anything else?
- Discuss (20)

Wrap up
- remember readings and discussion posts for 2 weeks from now.

** week 2, artificial intelligence I

Agenda
- topic today: artificial intelligence
- some writing about the readings
- some talking about the readings
- break
- talking about AI, maybe going into depth about how it works

*** discussion posts
Aracely: "how do we address prejudices while also leaving room for
reclamation? How do we program AI models to be able to discern harmful
language from reappropriation?"

Maria: the persistent tension between the fight for worker protections
and workers’ dependence on these jobs for livelihood.


*** introductions 10 min
Name, program, one thing you want to learn how to do.

*** mapping the readings 30m
What is the main argument for each reading? 

*** discussion post share 10 min
Each person summarizes what they wrote about, and why they find it interesting.

*** reframe your chosen point as a question 5 minutes
Then, as a group, you decide one point to share with the class.

But, before you share with the class, re-write your point as a
discussion question. You want to write a question that is open-ended
(not a yes/no question), and that would inspire different kinds of
responses.

For example, if your interest is something like, "the difficulty of
removing bias and discriminatory views from the data used to train AI
chatbots," you might re-frame the question like, "what are actual ways
that we can make AI training datasets less discriminatory and biased?"
OR you might go deeper to ask something like, "if we cannot remove
bias from datasets, is it possible to use AI tools in an ethical way?
How could we do that?"

Try to write questions that inspire curiosity and different points of
view. This is actually hard to do, so just try your best!

*** share 10 minutes
Go around the room and share your questions, writing them down on the
googledoc.

Then, I (filipa) choose a question to start the conversation. We can
take a minute or so to think about responding before discussion.

*** break 15 min

*** discussion 45 min

*** how does chatgpt work? 20 min
**** How does ChatGPT work?
How does it know what to respond when someone asks it a question?

More specifically, how does it know what language to generate, what
words follow other words?
- by prediction.
- it learns by reading. Gains an understanding of language from
  processing massive amounts of text, deriving patterns.

It builds a kind of model for each word, what words tend to surround
that word in a sentence.
- key idea here is "context"

This model for meaning is called a "word vector" '

**** Word Vectors
Word Vectors:
- numerical representation of words. Words represented by numbers, a
  list of numbers.
- Each number represents that word's relation to another word, in the
  form of a probability. How they are related.
  - here we have a word, "Artificial" and related words, each with
    similarity scores.
  - the similarity scores together comprise the vector.

Let's take the word "cat" and "dog" 
- furry, milk, bone, lick
  
This is how we turn language, the semantics and expressivity of
language, into something a computer can understand.

Every word becomes a dot in graphical space, and is represented by a
list of numbers, very long. 

**** King - Man + Woman = Queen
Not only do computers process language, but they can do math with it.
- Each word is represented by a series of numbers,
  with each of those numbers representing it's relationship to another
  word. How closely they are related.

Linear algebra, matrix algebra.

Calculus.

Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. 

Read more in the Word2Vec Paper.

*** readings

**** Bender, E. M., Gebru, T., McMillan-Major, A., & Shmitchell, S. (2021, March). On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?. In Proceedings of the 2021 ACM conference on fairness, accountability, and transparency (pp. 610-623). https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922
- who?
  - Bender, comp linguist scholar at UWash
  - Gebru, former Google AI Ethics researcher, now helps to lead DAIR
  - Smitchell, former Google AI Ethics researcher, now at Huggingface
- when?
  - published in 2021, way ahead of its time (ChatGPT came out Fall
    2022).
- What is the main argument?
  - Ethical implications of one aspect about LLMs: SIZE
    - 1. environmental effects
    - 2. socio-economic effects -> more likely to affect marginalized
      people
      - "increasing the environmental and financial costs of these
        models doubly punishes marginalized com- munities that are
        least likely to benefit from the progress achieved by large
        LMs and most likely to be harmed by negative environ- mental
        consequences of its resource consumption" (610).
    - 3. bias and discrimination -> date
      - "overrepresent hegemonic viewpoints and encode biases"
    - 4. human interpretation of text as meaningful leads to
      misinformation/misinterpretation
- Environmental costs
  - those most likely to pay the price of environmental degradation
    are in the global south, and are those who are least likely to
    benefit from the tools being developed.
  - "most language technology is built to serve the needs of those who
    already have the most privilege in society." (613).
- "Unfathomable training data"
  - "size doesn't gaurantee diversity"
    - we assume large size means more representation, but that's not
      the case. "Internet data overrepresenting younger users and
      those from developed countries."
    - statistical methods amplify what is most frequent. They suppress
      outliers.
    - we get something that perpetuates a majority view: users who are
      young, male, from developed countries.
  - we cannot automate the removal of bias
    - list of dirty, naughty, etc. words.
    - removing whole pages containing bad words overlooks context,
      nuance, reclamation, explanation.
  - what is the solution?
    - avoid "documentation debt" by budgeting to make high quality
      datasets.
      - document motivations behind data collection
      - document process of cleaning
      - "pre-mortem" - explore hypothetical failures
      - "value sensitive design" - make sure stakeholder values are
        supported from the outset.
- "communicative intent"
  - to communicate, we need to guess the intention of the speaker.
  - humans see meaning in everything, we have to impose meaning.
- solutions:
  - moving slowly, working with carefully curated datasets
  - "pre-mortems"
  - "value-sensitive design"

**** Perrigo, Billy. “Exclusive: The $2 Per Hour Workers Who Made ChatGPT Safer.” TIME. 18 Jan. 2023, https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/.
OpenAI hiring firm in Kenya to label datasets of violence, abuse for a
dollar and pennies per hour. Once people found out they stopped.

How are they doing it now? That's a good question to ask. 
**** Berhan Taye, “The Plight of AI Production Pipeline Workers”, from Design Justice in AI conference, July 2024. Watch video from start until minute 36: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBA_PZb2gdM
- research into AI harms, "datawork", that goes on under the scenes. 
- research methodolody:
  - interviews, focus groups.
- "datawork":
  - cleaning, augmenting, labelling.
  - explains what datawork entails.
- Research Findings:
  - clients are wide ranging, from DoD to photo editing apps for influencers
  - worker hierarchy to encourage workers to compete and even sabotage
    each other.
- Resistances:
  - multiple accounts on a single platform.
  - set up paid VPNs to get a better rate.
  - leasing, renting, selling well-rated accounts.
  - buying US-registered accounts.
  - browser extensions to keep reloading page. 
  - using messaging apps to keep connected with others, video calls to
    motivate each other.
- Solutions:
  - legal protections for platform workers
  - unionization
- Alternatives:
  - "resistance and sabotage"
  - cooperatives & worker-owned data shops.

conversation. 

The readings for next week: Haraway is the hardest. Read her like a
hawk.

**** Karen Hao, /The Empire of AI/, 2025.
- reads like an expose. There's drama. It's sort of breathless.
- presents AI companies enacting a modern day empire.
- emphasizes the psychology of the leader, Sam Altman.
- emphasizes the concentration of power.
- some good directions at the end of the book.
  
**** 2025 OSTP OSTP proposal, march 13, 2025
- Office of Science and Technology Policy proposal
- proposals to help OSTP develop "AI Action Plan ... that ensure[s]
  that American-led AI built on democratic principles continues to
  prevail over CCP-build autocratic, authoritarian AI".
- "democratic AI"
  - "a free market promoting free and fair competition.
  - "freedom for developers and users to work with our tools"
  - "preventing government use... to amass power and control their
    citizens"
- Positioning against China to create urgency for proposals. 
  - Deepseek is a threat because "simultaneously state-subsidized,
    state-controlled, and fully available... cost[ing] users privacy
    and security."
- point #3: "Copyright: Promoting the Freedom to Learn"
  - need to use copyrighted material to compete with China, a "matter
    of national security."
  - contradiction between China's "unfettered access" vs OpenAI's
    "fair use":
    - "Applying the fair use doctrine to AI is not only a matter of
      American competitiveness-—it’s a matter of national security.
      The rapid advances seen with the PRC’s DeepSeek, among other
      recent developments, show that America’s lead on frontier AI is
      far from guaranteed. Given concerted state support for critical
      industries and infrastructure projects, there’s little doubt
      that the PRC’s AI developers will enjoy unfettered access to
      data—including copyrighted data—that will improve their models.
      If the PRC’s developers have unfettered access to data and
      American companies are left without fair use access, the race
      for AI is effectively over. America loses, as does the success
      of democratic AI. Ultimately, access to more data from the
      widest possible range of sources will ensure more access to more
      powerful innovations that deliver even more knowledge" (10-11).
      
**** The Matrix (1999)
- what happens?
  - humankind trying to fight against AI rulers. Humankind created AI
    and it got smarter. Now traps humans in order to use them as an
    energy source.
  - what is the matrix?
    - the simulation they use in order to keep humans ignorant about
      the reality, that their bodies are used as energy sources.
      - the idea of humans being used as an energy source is a
        compelling one for our time, even in the real world.
    - mother; table of numbers
- what is the message of the film?
  - Love overcomes all.
  - Does the love story take over the story about revolution? After
    the guy betrays his team, it becomes a man vs man. About one man
    trying to screw over another one. Then it becomes about love
    overcoming that. 
- how does it apply to today?
  - the idea that we are living our lives in ignorance of the actual
    material conditions of our technology, this is true.
  - that humans are being used as a kind of source, for extraction.
    What exactly is being extracted? 

**** Joe Rogan interviewing Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, October 2023: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTJZpO3bTpg 
- story of technological development is "the story of abundance"
- costs will fall, abundance will go up. It will transform peoples'
  lives for the better.
- we will have some kind of universal income, where everyone will have
  a stake in the technology.

*** Readings:
**** Donna Haraway, “A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century,” from Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature. 1989. pp. 149-181.
- What does the *cyborg figure* enable Haraway to do? What does it
  allow her to signify or represent?
  - a mix of ideas, theories, even those taken from oppressive
    paradigms like the "informatics of domination"
  - "illegitimate offspring" (151).
  - probably the most useful thing about the cyborg figure, is that it
    is a pastiche, mixture, and allows us to take things that were
    created to oppress or to exploit, to separate and partition, and
    use them for creating new kinds of collectivities, communities,
    affinity-based solidarities.
- Critique of feminism: different feminisms have sought a kind of
  unification of women, which in every case serves to leave some women
  out. Identity politics is a problem, because any category
  necessarily overlooks someone. 
  - marxist feminism: women unified by an idea of labor.
  - radical feminism: women unified by sexualization/objectificaiton.
  - Haraway says that these unifications are totalizing, applying one
    definition to account for all women, which leaves out those
    already on the margins:
    - second wave feminism left out working class women, largely women
      of color, who were already in the workforce.
- "Informatics of Domination"
  - how power structures and paradigms are shifting over time, a
    problem but also an opportunity. 
  - new models for control in the networked age:
    - eugenics -> population control
    - race -> economic development
  - women are now in the "integrated circuit", in the "homework
    economy," poverty has been feminized.
- Language: a "problem of coding"
  - we do not want universal translation.
    - we are already cyborgs, the question is will we harness our
      partiality for resisiting domination, rather than submitting to
      exploitative and consumptive power? 
  - "irony", "blasphemy":
    - saying things that are not expected,
    - perverting something meant to be sacred. 


**** Lisa Nakamura. (2014). “Indigenous Circuits: Navajo Women and the Racialization of Early Electronic Manufacture,” American Quarterly 66(4): 919–41.
- "Haraway draws our attention to the irony that some must labor
  invisibly for others of us to feel, if not actually /be/, free and
  empowered through technology use: technoscience is, indeed, an
  integrated circuit, one that both separates and connects laborers
  and users, and while both genders benefit from cheap computers, it
  is the flexible labor of women of color, either outsourced or
  insourced, that made and continue to make this possible" (919).
- navajo women were exploited labor, were presented by Fairchild as a
  "labor of love", reproducing their culture in their work.
- "promotional materials... reveal how electronics assembly work
  became both gendered and identified with specific racialized
  qualities" (924).

Taking indigenous qualities and consigning them within an
industrialized / capitalistic framework.
- takes Navajo cultural skill of weaving and applies to to industrial
  work, saying that it "also requires the same personal commitment to
  perfection" (928).
- "Again, the notion of an “inherently flexible” laborer, a worker
  whose nature it is to be both adaptable and culturally suited, or
  hardwired, to craft circuit designs onto either yarn or metal
  appeals to a romantic notion of what Indians are and the role that
  they play in US histories of technology" (929-930).
  - appealing to Indian work as natural commodity.
- this framing "posits indigenous design as informing circuit
  design--a kind of colonialism in reverse--despite the lack of
  involvement of indigenous people in the company's research and
  development arm" (931).
- this painstaking precision work was redefined as creative work
  (935).
- "Navajo women did not make circuits because their brains naturally
  “thought” in patterns of right-angle colors and shapes. They did not
  make them well because they had inherent Indian virtues such as
  stoicism, pride in crafts- womanship, or an inherent and inborn
  manual dexterity. And Fairchild did not employ Navajo women because
  of these traits. These traits were identified after the company
  learned about the tax incentives available to subsidize the project,
  the lack of unions and other employment options in the area, and the
  generous donation of heavy equipment given by the US government
  gratis as part of an incentive to develop “light industry” as an
  “occupational education” for Indians" (935).

The "Platform" 
- our analysis of digital focuses too much on the interface, when we
  ought to focus on how digital is /procedural/.
- infrastructure as "whatever" - "the material conditions that are
  usually invisible to the user and are necessary for digital media
  device creation" (936).
  - cheap, female labor
- "Looking inside digital culture means both looking back in time to
  the roots of the computing industry and the specific material
  production practices that positioned race and gender as commodities
  in electronics factories. This labor is temporally hidden, within a
  very early period of digital computing history, and hidden
  spatially. We must look to locales and bodies not commonly
  associated with these technologies, in out of the way places, to see
  how race operates as a key aspect of digital platform production."
  (937-8).
- "On the spectrum of digital labor, factory work soldering chips for
  iPhones, missiles, and servers is as close to the machine as one can
  get, as close to the means of digital production— the computer— as
  can be imagined. It is not creative labor, nor is it free. It is
  fascinating that, during a pivotal moment in early computing
  history, the industry’s foremost electron- ics company represented
  it that way. This story of digital device manufacture on Indian land
  shows us how the discourse of women’s indigenous cultural production
  has been used to explain the key role that women of color play
  within the integrated circuit of production" (938).
 

*** IF TIME: Activity on Online Ads (20/30):
- visit two or more of the following:

  - https://x.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests
  - https://www.facebook.com/ads/about/?entry_product=ad_preferences
  - https://accountscenter.instagram.com/ad_preferences/
- Spend about 10 minutes exploring the settings on those pages,
  looking for records of things you like or things that the app thinks
  you will like.
  - You may have to click on things like "customize ads" or "ad
    preferences" to see your data.
- After poking around a bit, spend 10 minutes reflecting on the
  following: 
  - how accurate is the representation of your preferences? How
    surprised are you?
  - Think about the ways that these companiesshow you your personal
    data (the interface, the explanations, what do they show, and how
    do they show it?).
    - How do they want you to engage with this data?
    - What does this say about your data and its significance,
      marketability?
  - How does this relate to topics we've discussed (or haven't yet
    discussed) from our readings? 
 
** week 5, governance
Agenda
- introductions:
  - name, favorite disney character
- Review: what is the main argument for each reading? 
- Freewrite 5 min:
  - what was one part of the reading that was confusing or you didn't
    quite understand OR
  - something you found interesting
- Small groups: share and discuss for 10 minutes, pick one to share out
- Big group share: 15 min
- If time: start discussion, 15-30 minutes
  - define some key terms from each of these authors
    - surveillance capitalism
    - new jim code
    - big other
    - open evolution
    - universal standing
- BREAK
- continue discussion, going down the list of questions, 30 min
- or write on this prompt:
  - "Code" (New Jim Code, Open Code Socieites) means something
    different for Benjamin than it does for Lessig. What are these
    differences?
    - Do Benjamin and Lessig's ideas talk to each other? How might
      their ideas engage? Could you draw from both of them to talk to
      the theme of "governance" for this class? 
  - "Hacking"
    - "Technologies are constituted by unique affordances, but the
      development and expression of those affordances are shaped by
      the institutional logics in which technologies are designed,
      implemented, and used. This is, after all, the origin of the
      hack. Hacking intends to liberate affordances from the
      institutional logics in which they are frozen and redistribute
      them in alternative conﬁgurations for new purposes" (Zuboff 85).
      - what are some possibilities for hacking the big data system?
	- open source: giving, contributing to our communities. What
          Lessig says about "giving away what one makes, with no
          guarantee of compensation" (Lessig 107).
  
- brainstorming final projects: 30 min
  - freewrite: 10 minutes
    - From the past month, what are some of the class conversations or
      ideas from the reading that you found most compelling?
      - what about these did you find interesting?
      - then, identify 2 or 3 keywords or key phrases associated with your interest.
  - Share with a partner, 5 minutes
  - Share as a class, making a list of keywords on the board.

*** readings
**** Ruha Benjamin - Introduction, from Race After Technology: Abolitionist
Tools for the New Jim Code

Talks about how new technologies perpetuate historical prejudices
about blackness.

Current society perpetuates racism by transforming it into ever new
tools, in this case, data gathering and surveillance, machine
learning.

"The New Jim Code" - "the employment of new technologies that reflect
and reproduce existing inequalities but that are promoted and
perceived as more objective or progressive than the discriminatory
systems of a previous era" (3).
- what is Jim Crow? Segregation laws in the USA
- some names are "normal" (neutral) in our society. That just means
  they are unmarked.
- the term "code" here means something specific.
  - It means information, markup, about a person.
  - "Codes are both reflective and predictive". They indicate the way
    that a person will be treated.
  - Code means something different for Benjamin than it does for
    Lessig. 

The values that drive tool production -- objectivity, profitability --
are inherently racist:
- “Far from coming upon a sinister story of racist programmers
  scheming in the dark corners of the web, we will find that the
  desire for objectivity, efficiency, profitability, and progress
  fuels the pursuit of technical fixes across many different social
  arenas. Oh, if only there were a way to slay centuries of racial
  demons with a social justice bat! But, as we will see, the road to
  inequity is paved with technical fixes” (7).
- “The animating force of the New Jim Code is that tech designers
  encode judgments into technical systems but claim that the racist
  results of their designs are entirely exterior to the encoding
  process” (11-12).
- “With emerging technologies we might assume that racial bias will be
  more scientifically rooted out. Yet, rather than challenging or
  overcoming the cycles of inequity, technical fixes too often
  reinforce and even deepen the status quo” (3).
- “The animating force of the New Jim Code is that tech designers
  encode judgments into technical systems but claim that the racist
  results of their designs are entirely exterior to the encoding
  process” (6).

  → are tools good or bad in themselves? I have believed in the past
  that tools can be used in good or bad ways. That it was about
  agency, activity, discovery, performance. But it seems that tools
  themselves contain biases. What is the role of human agency in using
  biased tools?

Our current tools perpetuate old biases:
- This is meant as an extension of New Jim Crow, which argues that
  current society perpetuates racism by criminalizing it, war on
  drugs, mass incarceration. It diverts racist action into new forms.
  The newest form of this diversion is technology.
- “These tech advances are sold as morally superior because they
  purport to rise above human bias, even though they could not exist
  without data produced through histories of exclusion and
  discrimination” (5).

Race is a technology, a tool: 
- “This field guide explores not only how emerging technologies hide,
  speed up, or reinforce racism, but also how race itself is a kind of
  technology – one designed to separate, stratify, and sanctify the
  many forms of injustice experienced by members of racialized groups,
  but one that people routinely reimagine and redeploy to their own
  ends” (19).
- “this text presents a case for understanding race itself as a kind
  of tool – one designed to stratify and sanctify social injustice as
  part of the architecture of everyday life” (9).

Being marked, named:
- "the presumed blandness of White American culture is a crucial part
  of our national narrative."
- “Invisibility, with regard to Whiteness, offers immunity. To be
  unmarked by race allows you to reap the benefits but escape
  responsibility for your role in an unjust system” (2).
- “The view that “technology is a neutral tool” ignores how race also
  functions like a tool, structuring whose literal voice gets embodied
  in AI. In celebrating diversity, tokenistic approaches to tech
  development fail to acknowledge how the White aesthetic colors AI.
  The “blandness” of Whiteness that some of my students brought up
  when discussing their names is treated by programmers as normal,
  universal, and appealing” (15).

  → white people want tech to make them invisible. The opposite
  impulse has to employ the body, prioritize the marked body. Make the
  body hypervisible and open to vulnerability.

  → Wendy Chun’s image of the window. The screen goes both ways. You
  are already being seen when you use technology.

**** Zuboff, S. (2015). Big other: Surveillance Capitalism and the
Prospects of an Information Civilization. Journal of Information
Technology, 30(1), 75-89. https://doi.org/10.1057/jit.2015.5

This is a perspective from 2015, how does this compare to Ruha
Benjamin writing about race in 2021? (Benjamin would say that
rather than a break with the past, we are doing more of the same). 

What about the terminology here, what does it give us that others
don't?

- "big data"
  - "is above all the foundational component in a deeply intentional
    and highly consequential new logic of accumulation that I call
    surveillance capitalism" (75).
    - "new logic of accumulation" -- would Benjamin agree that this
      logic is new? 

- "surveillance capitalism"
  - "unexpected and often illegible *mechanisms* of extraction,
    commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from
    their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral
    prediction and modification."
  - from "market capitalism" to "surveillance capitalism"

- "big other"
  - "a ubiquitous networked institutional *regime* that records,
    modiﬁes, and commodiﬁes everyday experience from toasters to
    bodies, communication to thought, all with a view to establishing
    new pathways to monetization and proﬁt. Big Other is the sovereign
    power of a near future that annihilates the freedom achieved by
    the rule qof law." (81)

- "informate"
  - the ability of a machine to produce information while carrying out
    instructions. It turns normal activities into an "electronic
    text".

- "logic of accumulation"
  - which underlies technological tools like Google search. There's an
    old desire to incorporate more and more machines to "enable more
    continuity and control," and this development has led to not only
    efficient work but also the production of more information, which
    can then be further analyzed, and used to automate, optimize, etc.
  - "The logic of accumulation organizes perception and shapes the
    expression of technological affordances at their roots. It is the
    taken-for-granted context of any business model. Its assumptions
    are largely tacit, and its power to shape the ﬁeld of
    possibilities is therefore largely invisible" (77).

  -> "logic of accumulation" is one of those things that contribute to
  notions of "objectivity" and "efficiency" which we so value in our
  tools, and which, according to Benjamin, perpetuate racism.

- A google exec identifies "four uses" of computation, which Zuboff
  shows they create a new kind of capitalism that's called
  "surveillance capitalism"
  - 'data (quantity over quality) extraction (one way relationship)
    and analysis'
    - rather than raising wages with profits, the employee is more
      distanced from the employer.
    - The assets are "surveillance assets", they are taken from users
      often without their knowledge
      -> isn't this is like the plundering of natural resources,
      whereas now we are plundering human attention?
  - ‘new contractual forms due to better monitoring’
    - they are actually creating new rules around privacy. Going
      around and extracting data until they are stopped. How they got
      "Street View". (And how ChatGPT was created, too).
      - "New possibilities of subjugation are produced as this
        innovative institutional logic thrives on unexpected and
        illegible mechanisms of extraction and control that exile
        persons from their own behavior" (85).
  - ‘personalization and customization'
  - 'continuous experiments'

**** Lessig, Lawrence. (1999). “Open code and open societies: values of
internet governance,” Chicago-Kent Law Review 74, 101–116.
https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/final.P

- How do we read this today?
  - All you need to connect to a URL is an IP address. That's all.
  - "Nothing requires that the other side learn anything real about
    you" (103).

Code implies values, defines space, page 104:
- the code now protects privacy, but this won't always be the case,
  because commerce does not like privacy.
- "engineers are governors" (104).

  --> he agrees with Zuboff and Benjamin about the implicit politics
  in technology, that technological affordances contain values. But
  where does he differ?

The internet is a product of a very specific history
- started as a defense project, money to build up security
- moved to an academic research project
- made with open standards like HTML and HTTP

What is the "commons"? 

A network can only grow if it is open (which means that all companies
trying to make money off of it are profiting from open/free
resources).

Values encoded into open source:
- "Open-Evolution" - things are built on a minimal structure so that
  they can grow in multiple directions. "Do not play god". "Keep the
  core simple".
  - "modularity" - not about just efficiency or transparency, but
    "permits code to be modified; it permits one part to be
    substituted for another" (111).
  - "jurisdiciton" - decentralized; so change comes from the masses,
    from the bottom up. No one person can control the development.
- "Universal Standing" - it is open so that anyone can work on it,
  improve it. Not like politics that's only open to the crazies and
  the rich.
  - free to entry
  - the foundation of the internet as a commons

How might Benjamin respond to these values? Would she say they are
perpetuating "coded inequality"? In what ways? 

** week 6, design
Goals

- introductions

- review the readings
  - /Design Justice/ introduction:
  - "An Archive of Our Own" research study:
  - "The Plight of AI Production Pipeline Workers" video:  
  
- freewrite/discussion(5/5/25) - 1 hr
  - what questions or areas of interest do you have about these
    frameworks, or about the readings in general?
    - make a list of topics.
    - go down the list.
    
BREAK

- freewrite 7 min:
  - thinking about design. 
  - if your grandmother/father or great-grandmother/father (or some
    elder friend, family member, or caregiver) could use the internet,
    what do you think they most want to do on it? How would they want
    to spend their time? Can you imagine and describe the ideal
    interface for them (for web browsing, apps, etc.)?
    - Vovo would want to look at paintints. She would want the user
      interface to be incredible. Maybe like a flipbook of paintings,
      she could paginate through them, in the order that they are in
      the gallery/museum. She could zoom into detail.
      - Then, she could see other paintings by that artist in the
        museum, and in other museums. She could quickly navigate
        between different paintings in different museums, but all on
        the same interface. The UI would be the same regardless of the
        particular group who holds the painting.
	- Viewing art wouldn't be contained by individual private
          entities, but by one crowd sourced one. 
	- Kind of like a wikipedia.

**** Costanza-Chock, Sasha (2020). “Introduction: #TravelingWhileTrans, Design Justice, and Escape from the Matrix of Domination” in Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need. https://designjustice.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ap8rgw5e/release/1
The milimeter scanner is not meaning to look for non-conformity in
gender; it's meant to look for terrorism. It just happens to encode
this assumption into its UI.

Small assumptions built into UI will scale up with AI: 
- The same cisnormative, racist, and ableist approach that is used to
  train the models of the millimeter wave scanners is now being used
  to develop AI in nearly every domain. From my standpoint, I worry
  that the current path of AI development will repro-duce systems that
  erase those of us on the margins, whether intention-ally or not,
  through the mundane and relentless repetition of reductive norms
  structured by the matrix of domination. 

Normativity built into UI is constructed from multiple assumptions:
- "the particular sociotechnical configuration of gender normativity
  (cis-normativity, or the assumption that all people have a gender
  identity that is consistent with the sex they were assigned at
  birth) that has been built into the scanner, through the combination
  of user interface (UI) design, scanning technology, binary-gendered
  body-shape data constructs, and risk detection algorithms, as well
  as the socialization, training, and experi-ence of the TSA agents."
  (2). 

Draws from
- intersectionality
  - Kimberle Crenshaw, "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and
    Sex", 1989.
  - Krenshaw's definition in legal context. Black women are not
    represented by Civil Rights law that protects black people, and by
    law that protect womens' equality.
  - "single axis framework"
    - Used in lots of design, seeing only one dimension of
      marginalization (sex, race, ability). Opposed to intersectional
      framework.
- matrix of domination
  - due to intersectional analysis, we can see the existence of a
    "matrix of domination" where race, class, and gender act together
    to create different levels of oppression. Everyone has benefits
    and harms across this matrix.
  - Patricia Hill Collins, 1990, /Black Feminist Thought/.

Design Justice "Principles":
- good intentions are not enought to ensure that "design processes and
  practices become tools for liberation", but also need principles.
- "a framework of analysis of how design distributes benefits and
  burdens between various groups of people. Design justice focuses
  explicitly on the ways that design reproduces and/or challenges the
  matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism,
  ableism, settler colonialism, and other forms of structural
  inequity)."

**** McKinney, Cait. 2015. Body, Sex, Interface: Reckoning with Images at the Lesbian Herstory Archives. Radical History Review 122: 115–28.
About the work being done at a community, volunteer run archives.

Asks a central question, very related to Hartman, which is: *how do we
catalog things, make them visible and accessible, without also
incorporating/subscribing them into a normalizing scheme*? How do we
label things and allow them to maintain a certain kind of dynamicity?

Much of the data in the archives cannot be fully
categorized/catagloged and digitized, because (1) we never got that
information from the donor, we take everything and anything,
"undescribability" and lack of donor agreements, and (2) we don't have
the resources to do all of that work.
- folksonomies
- "the ways that all kinds of sex practices and gendered ways of being
  scramble the categorical logics of structured databases" (3).

Designing for serendipitious experiences (the interface): 
- What kind of interface would replicate some of the "uncategorizable"
  aspects of the materials?
- "Pulling a “what do you say about this?” image out of the photo
  drawer evokes wonder, because the ways these photos do not make
  sense are difficult to catalog and capture through mechanisms such
  as the searchable database form" (10).

Being visible vs being integrated/maintreamed:
- There is a desire for access, which is good. But being seen also
  suggests being included, and being included into what kind of
  citizen:
- "LGBT archives are worlding technologies that can be called on to
  support homonational trends, in which the recognition of gay and
  lesbian citizen-subjects as rightly historical is tied to broader
  political agendas of gendered and racialized violence, exclusion,
  and empire in the present. Photographic archives, in particular,
  shift this politics into a regime of visibility that associates
  being seen with being welcomed into the fold of liberalism" (8).

**** Hartman, Saidiya. "Venus in Two Acts." Small Axe, vol. 12 no. 2,   2008, p. 1-14. Project MUSE muse.jhu.edu/article/241115.

Her main question is how can we write history under these conditions
of scarcity/absence and of language: 
- “How does one revisit the scene of subjection without replicating
  the grammar of violence?” (4).

"The violence of the archive" - we only receive things in the violent
terms of their subjection. 
- "The archive of slavery rests upon a founding violence. This
  violence determines, regulates and organizes the kinds of statements
  that can be made about slavery and as well it creates subjects and
  objects of power" (10).
  - A condition also known as the "violence of the archive," she
    describes the archive as a "death sentence," because it only
    records the subject in the terms of their objectification, in "a
    display of the violated body, an inventory of property" (2).
- Hartman here looks at the problem of what to do with an absent
  archive. Not only absence in the form of evidence, that the literal
  records are missing, but also in the tools of expression, in
  language that cannot approximate the reality of experience, and in
  the discourse that dictates silence.

She seeks to recuperate (without recovering) the lives of these
subjects. To write about them in a way that does not do more damage,
but draws attention to the ways that their lives have been delineated
while inviting possibility for living. To create in the mode of
"critical fabulation" (11).

She examines the history of Venus, the unnamed slave woman who appears
variously throughout the "official" record. From this history, Hartman
concludes that there is no way forward with recovery. She turns to
consider a series of paradoxical questions:
- “how does one rewrite the chronicle of a death foretold and
  anticipated, as a collective biography of dead subjects, as a
  counter-history of the human, as the practice of freedom?” (3).
- "how does one recuperate lives entangled with and impossible to
  differentiate from the terrible utterances that condemned them to
  death, the account books that identified them as units of value, the
  invoices that claimed them as property, and the banal chronicles
  that stripped them of human features?" (3)
- “How can narrative embody life in words and at the same time respect
  what we cannot Know?” (3).
- “If it is no longer sufficient to expose the scandal, then how might
  it be possible to generate a different set of descriptions from this
  archive?" (7).

The archivist of slavery comes up against the incommensurability
between reality and the historical record, the archivist must endeavor
to engage this incommensurability: "to expose and exploit the
incommensurability between the experience of the enslaved and the
fictions of history, by which I mean the requirements of narrative,
the stuff of subjects and plots and ends" (10).
- "This double gesture can be described as straining against the
  limits of the archive to write a cultural history of the captive,
  and, at the same time, enacting the impossibility of representing
  the lives of the captives precisely through the process of
  narration" (11).

In the scarcity of material (not one autobiographical account of a
female survives), most of what we have left are numbers. Can we then
fill the void with stories? 
- "Loss gives rise to longing, and in these circumstances, it would
  not be far-fetched to consider stories as a form of compensation or
  even as reparations, perhaps the only kind we will ever receive"
  (4).
 
**** Drabinski, Emily. “Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction.” The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy, vol. 83, no. 2, 2013, pp. 94–111

What does queer theory give to cataloguing? It gives a perspective
that nothing will ever be perfectly described. That engaging with
materials is a dialogical process, that markup will always be complex
and biased.

"dialogic engagement" - a back and forth engagement with sources,
rather than a one-way engagement.

Narrative around Gay and Lesbian Studies vs Queer Theory.
- G&L was about filling a gap, giving voice to an absence, and QT was
  about outlining the queer subject.

The location of where queer and trans books have been cataloged, as
sexual deviance, trans next to homosexuality, suggesting certain kinds
of relationships between them.

The subject headings themselves containing bias.

Queer theory assumes that all categorizing schemas are contingent to
history and context. Nothing is universal.

Queer is always in resistance. It needs a norm in order to define
itself against. "Lesbian should be replaced by Dyke" (103).

**** Sandy Stone. "Split Subjects, Not Atoms; or, How I Fell in Love with My Prosthesis." Configurations, vol. 2 no. 1, 1994, p. 173-190.
About the ways that virtual technologies change our relationship to
agency, and the potential possibilities and harms from this.

This essay is the first chapter of her book, /The War of Desire and
Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age/, which is a revision of
her dissertation, which was supervised by Donna Haraway.

Professor at UT Austin, does film/music studies, background as a sound
engineer before moving to academia. Was involved in some TERFy
controversies in the 70s.

Wrote "The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto" which is
credited with starting Trans Studies. Argument for trans people to
come out rather than simply pass, which was super controversial for
her time and even today. 

The compression of sensory experience. Data compression, sense
modality is compressed to be sent over the wires.

- "The sex workers took an extremely complex, highly detailed set of
  behaviors, translated them into a single sense modality, then
  further boiled them down to a series of highly compressed tokens."

People who are using new forms of technology -- the youth -- have a
real opportunity to change social relations. If gamers cared about
feminism, for example, they could make games about that. 

**** Oliver Haimson, “Introduction” from Trans Technologies, 2025, p. 1-14 (just read this excerpt of the longer chapter).

"Trans technologies"

Technology vs Trans Technology:
- "Most technology responds to fairly mundane problems like
  these--problems that are rarely critically related to their
  creators’ identities and life chances. With trans technology,
  though, technological innovations are frequently created in direct
  response to the oppressive conditions trans people face in the
  social, legal, and medical spheres: transphobia, violence, antitrans
  legislation, difficulty identifying supportive resources, and lack
  of access to medical care." (5).

Care and Ambivalence
- tech creating structures of trans care
- tech supporting ambivalent identitys: multiplicity rather than
  fluidity.

- Use of Emotions: Does the piece try to make the audience feel a
  certain way (e.g., fear, hope, outrage, empathy)? How?

  the piece use to support its argument? Does it include statistics,
  expert opinions, personal stories, or logical explanations?
- Language & Style: What words, images, or tone stick out to you, and
  why?

**** Ensmenger, Nathan. (2018). “The Environmental History of Computing.” Technology and Culture 59 (4S): S7–33.

About the ways that technological development and resource extraction
works:
- how it tends to develop off the backs of existing tech;
- how it tends toward reading the environment (weather, longitude,
  census) for the sake of mastery (imperialism).
- how it seeks to "annihilate space and time" (railroad, telegraph).
- "information technology does not so much eliminate as conceal the
  materiality of the so-called “new” economy"

"we experience only the positive benefits of information technology,
in large part because the labor and geography associated with the
construction, maintenance, and dismantling our digital devices has
been rendered largely invisible." (s10)

"when we look at the vast web of wires, cables, towers, generators,
and other physical equipment that underlies the apparently virtual
realm of Cyberspace—-the digital present does not seem quite so
discontinuous with our industrial past" (s10).

** week 12, fieldwork & writing day I
Goals
- share
- start to come up with an outline 
- share arguments

Agenda
- introductions:
- share fieldword (1-1.5 hrs)
- break
- brainstorm argument 30-40m:
  - you're doing a rhetorical analysis of two examples. The point of
    the paper is going to be an argument about how each source makes
    their argument.
    - you're really trying to analyze the form, the strategies, of an
      argument or a message.
    - from here, you'll be able to create some kind of
      argument/analysis of how that topic is being handled across your
      two sources. 
  - freewrite 15m:
    - what is the main argument/message of each of my examples?
    - what are some strategies they use to present that
      argument/message?
      - how does each author establish urgency/importance around the
        topic?
      - what are some interesting differences and/or similarities
        between the two examples?
    - taking the above two points into account, what is /your/
      working thesis for your paper?
  - share in groups, 10 min; share as class 10m
- outlines 10m:
  - how to write an outline?
  - thesis, one bullet for each paragraph.
    - for each paragraph, one intended bullet for the evidence. 
- next week, detailed outlines due. Not just points you want to make,
  but also evidence. 

** week 13, writing day II

Goals
- show you rubric
- introduce asynchronous activity
- mini conferences
  
Agenda
- Link to grading rubric 10 min
- Activity (asynchronous)
  - Focused Drafting: “Write Your Strongest Paragraph”
    - Select the section of your outline that feels clearest or most
      compelling to you.
    - Then, use the outline as a guide to draft a full paragraph for
      that section, focusing on:
      - Expanding bullet points into complete sentences.
      - Adding examples, quotes, or evidence from your book to support key points.
      - Including some sentences that explain the quotation in your
        own words, and its significance to your overall point.

Mini-conferences sign up. Each conference will be 10 minutes maximum. 

Homework: 5 full pages, double spaced.

** week 14, writing day III
Agenda:
- mini-conferences
- peer review

Schedule:
- intros (15)
- review peer review instructions (15)
- mini-conferences / peer review, 2 rounds (60)
- BREAK (20)

- what was useful, what isn't useful?
- next time, have full drafts and we will talk about intros &
  conclusions.


*** Peer review instructions:
Peer Review: Argumentation & Analysis (25 minutes)

First, read the paper entirely.

Then, answer the questions about “Body Paragraphs”, and “Thesis”, and
“Overall feedback,” in that order.

Body paragraphs (10m):
Focus argument: 
Indicate 1-2 places in the paper where the argument could be better
developed or connected to the thesis.

Deepen analysis:
Indicate 1-2 places in the paper where the examples can be analyzed
more critically or in greater depth.
Make a concrete suggestion for how the author might focus or expand
their critique.

Thesis (5m): 
The thesis should present a clear and compelling argument about the
chosen examples.
The author should make a case for how to read these examples together.
Make a suggestion for how the author might re-write their thesis for
clarity and strength of argument (even if the thesis is already
strong, re-write it in your own words).


Overall feedback (10m):
At the end of the paper, include a comment describing the paper’s
strongest element (e.g., a particularly insightful argument, clear
organization, or effective use of evidence, writing style).

At the end of the paper, include a comment that identifies one area
for improvement.
