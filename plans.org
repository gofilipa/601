** week 1, introduction to the course
Agenda:
- Syllabus day
- introductions, myself and you
- overview of the course, assignments, readings
- break
- talk about reading for grad school
- talk about information studies and unpack "information"

Myself
- Filipa Calado, call me Professor.
- Background in Literature, Queer studies, Digital Studies
- Using technology to study queer literature (dissertation)
- Now interested in language broadly, how meaning changes across
  different forms of language, how these are affected by technology
  (recently things like AI) and how to use tech to study language.
- Teaching for 8 years across NYC universities, NYU, New School,
  CUNY; classes on writing, critical thinking, data science, creative
  coding. So a wide range.
- First semseter teaching at Pratt, am very excited.

The course
- INFO 601:
  - Introduction to the field of "information studies"
    - broad term, encompasses work by librarians, analysts, cultural
      heritage curators, managers
  - Exploring the question, what is information? How does form affect
    meaning? Source, platform, speaker, audience, material substrate.
  - Thinking critically about information production
  - Different specializations and jobs available to info practitioners
  - Also, an introduction to graduate school, to thinking, reading,
    and writing critically.
    - how to insert yourself into an academic/professional
      conversation.
  - Finally, we take a critical perspective that pays attention to
    structures of power and how they affect all aspects of
    information.
- Assignments:
  - readings every week
  - posting on discussion board every week
  - some 'fieldwork' (attending 2 events and writing about it)
  - final project (book review) highly scaffolded
  - class discussion major focus.

Will go through the syllabus in more detail. But for now let's do
introductions.

Around the room, say your name, program, and best content you've
consumed lately.
- Professor Calado, I'm faculty, no program. But I would have been in
  Data Analysis probably; and House of the Dragon. So good. Well
  paced.

Syllabus Review
- Go over:
  - Course Info
  - Instructor Info
  - Course Description
  - Course Goals

    post.
  - Fieldwork
    - 2x/semester, reports due on Nov 26 on Canvas, and you will also
      share them in class the week that you do them. 5 minutes max, so
      like 2 page report.
    - gets you to experience the field in practice, attend events like
      talks and lectures
    - can be virtual
    - one of them should be the Ethics and Technology forum end of
      October, we will be reading the speaker's book anyway.
    - ask me if you are not sure if something counts.

      - review a court case
      - do an analysis of your chosen activity, submit online, and we
        will spend an entire day sharing and discussing them.
  - Book Review
    - final project
    - highly scaffolded, will work in parts, proposal, drafts.
    - choose a book from the last 3 years and review it. Make a case
      for older books
    - summarize argument, significance, context.
    - about 12 pages.
    - last month of the semseter will be focused on this assignment.
  - Course Schedule
    - weeks are broken up into "themes" in bold
    - example: next week is AI, the follwing is being online
    - Also weeks that pertain to different programs in the dept, like
      design and archives
    - do not read ahead
    - questions?

BREAK

How to read for grad school
- how do you read longer things? More academic things?
- what strategies (if any) do you use?
- is there an order or way to go about it?
- Now, read the article in 10 minutes, while thinking about:
  - Do these seem like good strategies, why or why not?
  - What have you done that works for you, and what do you think
    wouldn't work?
- share & discuss


"Information" freewrite and discussion
- 5 minutes
  - Where do you get your information? Make a list.
  - How do you determine if it's good or bad information? Credible?
    How important is this step?
  - What is the biggest challenge to consuming information in today's
    world?
- pair & share

Wrap up
- remember readings and discussion posts!

** week 2, artificial intelligence

Agenda
- topic today: artificial intelligence
- some writing about the readings
- some talking about the readings
- break
- talking about AI, maybe going into depth about how it works
- some prep for next week's AI activity

*** introductions 10 min
Name, program, one thing you want to learn how to do. 

*** freewrite 10 min
- What idea or detail from the reading was most interesting to you?
  What do you find so compelling about it? Why is it important?

*** share in groups of 2 or 3 people 10 minutes
Each person shares what they wrote.

Then, as a group, you decide one point to share with the class.

*** reframe your chosen point as a question 5 minutes
But, before you share, try to re-write your point as a question. You
want to write a question that is open-ended (not a yes/no question),
and that would inspire different kinds of responses.

For example, if your interest is something like, "the difficulty of
removing bias and discriminatory views from the data used to train AI
chatbots," you might re-frame the question like, "what are actual ways
that we can make AI training datasets less discriminatory and biased?"
OR you might go deeper to ask something like, "if we cannot remove
bias from datasets, is it possible to use AI tools in an ethical way?
How could we do that?"

Try to write questions that inspire curiosity and different points of
view. This is actually hard to do, so just try your best!

*** share 10 minutes
Go around the room and share your questions, writing them down on the
googledoc.

Then, I (filipa) choose a question to start the conversation. We can
take a minute or so to think about responding before discussion.

*** discussion 45 min

IFLA (2023). “Generative AI for Library and Information Professionals
(draft), https://www.ifla.org/generative-ai
- IFLA: Interational Federation of Library Associations and
  Institutions
- What is it about?
  - Guide on what is Generative AI for people who work in information
    professions and lack technical background.
  - has excellent sources cited.
  - emphasizes ethics and mis/dis-information issues:
    - bias, hallucination
    - overwhelming amounts of information
    - lack of transparency of how they are made
    - lack of privacy for users
    - issue of copyright and stealing the training data
    - can eliminate jobs, and put people w/o access at disadvantage
    - capitalism, big tech runs it.

- Discuss:
  - how do the "good" qualities of AI compare with the "bad"?
  - how can or should we use AI if it's not ethical?
    - maybe we shouldn't?
    - use it as part of a workflow, for summarizing, describing. Even
      drafting. But as /part/ of work and not the whole.

Too Big?. In Proceedings of the 2021 ACM conference on fairness,
accountability, and transparency (pp. 610-623).
https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922
- who?
  - Bender, comp linguist scholar at UWash
  - Gebru, former Google AI Ethics researcher, now helps to lead DAIR
  - Smitchell, former Google AI Ethics researcher, now at Huggingface

- published in 2021, way ahead of its time (ChatGPT came out Fall
  2022).

- What is the main argument?
  - Ethical implications of one aspect about LLMs: SIZE
    - environmental effects
    - socialeconomic effects - marginalized people
    - bias and discrimination - data
    - human interpretation of text as meaningful leads to
      misinformation/misinterpretation

- "Unfathomable training data"
  - "size doesn't gaurantee diversity"
    - we assume large size means more representation, but that's not
      the case.
    - statistical methods amplify what is most frequent. They suppress
      outliers.
    - we get something that perpetuates a majority view: users who are
      young, male, from developed countries.
  - we cannot automate the removal of bias
    - list of dirty, naughty, etc. words.
    - removing whole pages containing bad words overlooks context,
      nuance, reclamation, explanation.
  - what is the solution?
    - avoid "documentation debt" by budgeting to make high quality
      datasets.
      - document motivations behind data collection
      - document process of cleaning
      - "pre-mortem" - explore hypothetical failures
      - "value sensitive design" - make sure stakeholder values are
        supported from the outset.

- "communicative intent"
  - to communicate, we need to guess the intention of the speaker.
  - humans see meaning in everything, we have to impose meaning. 


Read Princeton University Library Libguide on Generative AI’s
“Copyright” page,
https://libguides.princeton.edu/c.php?g=1341922&p=10257371.
- Authors Guild vs OpenAI & Microsoft
  - plaintiffs allege that OpenAI stole content in a way that affects
    creators' livelihoods.
  - defendants say it's "Fair Use" due to highly transformative nature
    of LLMs. That it goes beyond the jurisdiction of copyright law,
    we need new ways of litigating these objects.

- NYT vs OpenAi
  - NYT says training on their content is stealing
  - OpenAI says no, that it only trained to get a sense of language.
    That NYT doesn't own language forms.


Watch “What is AI? Part 1, with Meredith Whittaker | AI Now Salons” on
youtube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US8xKmD7G1s
- Former google employee, now speaks out against Big Tech; CEO of
  Signal messaging app
- What is her argument?
  - AI companies are not only concentrating power, but are also a
    result of concentrated power. This is a structural problem.
  - "how do you democratize something that was created by centralized
    power?"
    - the compute required means only a few can host the models.
      Everyone else must rent it.
- She's putting forth a certain narrative about how AI came to be.
  - Privatization of the internet, was defense, academics, now
    private.
    - Surveillance business model, for advertizing
    - Now big tech sells server space, because they have the
      infrastructure for it. They also have the data. 
- What got her started thinking about the dangers of AI?
  - Harvard researcher came in talking about using AI to predict
    genocide. What is genocide in data? 
- What are the solutions?

First two sections, “What is compute and why does it matter?” & “How
is the demand for compute shaping AI development”, in Jai Vipra and
Sarah Myers West, “Computational Power and AI,” AI Now Institute,
September 27, 2023,
https://ainowinstitute.org/publication/policy/compute-and-ai.
- who is AI NOW?
  - research group, institute, on AI and AI policy. Explores dangers
    of AI and big tech on society, environment, economy.
- what is the main message?
  - compute is computational power
  - how does the industry concentration in compute affect the way that
    AI tech is being produced?
    - companies act quickly to protect their dominance, racing to
      release products before they are ready or safe.
    - further expands power and reach
    - money is bottom line
  - "compute stack" of hardware and software and infrastructure. 

*** break 15 min

*** continue discussion 30 min

*** how does chatgpt work? 20 min
**** How does ChatGPT work?
How does it know what to respond when someone asks it a question?

More specifically, how does it know what language to generate, what
words follow other words?
- by prediction.
- it learns by reading. Gains an understanding of language from
  processing massive amounts of text, deriving patterns.

It builds a kind of model for each word, what words tend to surround
that word in a sentence.
- key idea here is "context"

This model for meaning is called a "word vector" '

**** Word Vectors
Word Vectors:
- numerical representation of words. Words represented by numbers, a
  list of numbers.
- Each number represents that word's relation to another word, in the
  form of a probability. How they are related.
  - here we have a word, "Artificial" and related words, each with
    similarity scores.
  - the similarity scores together comprise the vector.

Let's take the word "cat" and "dog" 
- furry, milk, bone, lick
  
This is how we turn language, the semantics and expressivity of
language, into something a computer can understand.

Every word becomes a dot in graphical space, and is represented by a
list of numbers, very long. 

**** King - Man + Woman = Queen
Not only do computers process language, but they can do math with it.
- Each word is represented by a series of numbers,
  with each of those numbers representing it's relationship to another
  word. How closely they are related.

Linear algebra, matrix algebra.

Calculus.

Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.

System probe, privacy audit, or legal opinion.

Review the requirements for each, and use the rest of class time to
get started on the assignment. 

** week 3, artificial intelligence, continued
Agenda
- discuss AI activity
- continue discussions from last week's readings
- start to talk about final project, going to move up some of the work
  on that project, brainstorming things

  3-4 sentences per post.

Introductions, 10 min
- What was your dream job as a kid?
- Favorite disney movie?

Discuss AI Activity in Groups, 25 min
- split up by area: probe, audit, legal
- 20-25min: share what you did with your group, go into some detail
  about the questions you were asking or thinking about
  - what did you find most intriguing or interesting about the activity?
  - what's one question you have at the end of the process? In other
    words, where would you go from here?

  with the class.

Share out, 30 - 45 min
- write down the questions on the board
- anybody want to share their experiences?
- if nothing, point to the "can we ever really remove bias, and what
  would that look like?"

Discuss freewrite, 30 min

AI advertisement activity, 20 min (10/10):
- go to website for:
  - claude, gemini, or chatgpt
- look at their promotional materials, and think about:
  - what are they selling? what ideas or desires are they using to
    sell the product.
  - how is this product intended to be used, according to the ads?
  - what surfaces for you in terms of the advertisement culture, or AI
    generally?
  - (tough one) what are the possibilities for resistance here? Is
    there anything we can do as consumers? Or do we just not use
    products?

AT END
- mention that next week we will start to do some work for the final
  project in class.
  - looking at sources where to find books. Where do we find books?
    - book reviews
    - spend a few minutes looking for books in book reviews, something
      relevant to information studies. 
- next week, we may have visitors in the class. They are here to see
  me teach more than you.
