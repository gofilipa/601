\section{week 3, artificial intelligence, continued}
\label{sec:orgd435a0b}
Agenda
\begin{itemize}
\item discuss AI activity
\item continue discussions from last week's readings
\item start to talk about final project, going to move up some of the work
on that project, brainstorming things
\item weekly posts -- more "close reading", less abstract discussion. Best
way to do that is to focus on one particular detail or passage from
the reading. Start small, go into depth on that one thing.
\end{itemize}

Introductions, 10 min
\begin{itemize}
\item What was your dream job as a kid?
\end{itemize}

Freewrite 15 minutes:
\begin{itemize}
\item what was the most interesting quote, section, or detail from the
legislation that you read?
\begin{itemize}
\item You might choose a specific argument, explanation, or
justification from the case. Make sure you can identify a
particular page number or web page where you find the
quote/section/detail.
\end{itemize}
\item why did this stand out to you? Why is it significant in the context
of the larger argument?
\end{itemize}

Discuss AI Activity in Groups, 30 min
\begin{itemize}
\item split up into groups of 3-4
\item 20-25min: share about the case you did with your group, and what you
think is the most interesting section of the case.

\item 5-10 min: together, come up with one example to share with the
class.
\end{itemize}

Share out, 30 - 45 min
\begin{itemize}
\item write down the examples on the board
\end{itemize}

BREAK - 20 minutes

Freewrite, 10 min
\begin{itemize}
\item choose one to freewrite about
\item do a close analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Focus on the details of the section, like specific words used,
tone, perspective, audience, context---What are some of the
assumptions or implications associated with these details?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Discuss freewrite, 30-45 min

This is the kind of thing that I want you all to be doing in your
discussion board posts, at least as a way of starting and grounding
conversation. 

The readings for next week: Haraway is the hardest. Read her like a
hawk.
